# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this election audit analysis was to automate the work of counting votes from across several Colorado counties. With the use of python we were able to eliminate the need for a person to manually recount every vote tabulated in our CSV file. Our script will also be able to provide summary statistics around the election. Such as, the winning candidate, the number of votes cast for each candidate, and where the most votes were cast based off of voters resident county.
